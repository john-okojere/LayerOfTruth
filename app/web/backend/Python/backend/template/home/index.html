                <p>We were born Christians. As we call people who are not Christians, we were not sinners at birth. But we are aware that abiding by the law does not make one righteous in God's eyes. Trusting in Jesus Christ is what reconciles a person
                    to God. Since we want to be reconciled to God, we placed our confidence in Christ Jesus. And it is because of our faith in Christ, not because we kept the law, that we are right with him. I am able to say this because obeying the
                    law cannot make someone right with God. It is obvious that we Jews were also sinners since we came to Christ to be reconciled to God. Does this imply that we are sinners because of Christ? Of course not.</p>

            <p>I took my own life in accordance with the law because of the law itself. In order to live for God, I had to die to the law. Along with Christ, I was nailed on the cross. Therefore, Christ lives in me; I am not the one who lives now. Although
                I still have a physical body, I still have confidence in the Son of God. He is the one who gave of himself out of love for me. The purpose of God's grace is not to be destroyed by me. Christ did not have to die if keeping the law is
                how one is reconciled to God.</p>
